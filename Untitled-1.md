Form Handling & Dynamic Job Cards (Using JavaScript)
Students who have created the Job Portal frontend are required to implement the following features using JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Event Handling):
Create a job posting form to take job details (e.g., Job Title, Company Name, Location, Description, etc.).


On clicking the Submit button, the entered job data should be dynamically displayed as a job card on the page.


Each job card must be properly styled using CSS.


Add Delete and Update/Edit buttons inside each job card.


Delete should remove the job card.


Update/Edit should allow modifying the job details and saving the changes.
